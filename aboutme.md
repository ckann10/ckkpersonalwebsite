My name is Claudia Kann and I am a first year PhD student in the Social Sciences at Caltech. Working with Michael Alvarez and Jonathan Katz I am focusing on the structural explanations for misrepresentation in the political system at the local and federal level. I am also interested in election administration. My path to get to this point was a little bit windy...

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
